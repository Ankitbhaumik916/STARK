# STARK - Gesture Control with Computer Vision

STARK is a futuristic gesture control system built using Python and Computer Vision. Inspired by sci-fi tech like Tony Stark's interface, this project allows users to control digital interfaces using hand gestures in real time.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time hand and finger detection
- Gesture recognition using MediaPipe Hands
- Gesture-to-action mapping (e.g., play/pause, volume control, navigation)
- Supports multi-finger gestures
- Optimized for low latency

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe Hands
- PyAutoGUI / pynput (for simulating mouse and keyboard inputs)

## 📂 File Structure

```
STARK/
├── main.py               # Entry point to run the application
├── gesture_controller.py # Contains gesture recognition logic
├── utils.py              # Helper functions and utilities
├── config.py             # Configuration for gestures and controls
└── README.md             # This file
```

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/STARK
cd STARK
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## ✋ Supported Gestures

| Gesture | Action         |
|---------|----------------|
| ✊ Fist  | Pause/Stop     |
| 🖐️ Palm | Play/Start     |
| 👉 Point | Next/Forward   |
| 👌 Pinch| Confirm/Select |

Custom gestures can be configured in `config.py`.

## 💡 Future Plans

- Add voice command integration
- VR/AR compatibility
- User-defined gesture training module
- UI overlay for better feedback

## 🧠 Ideal Use Cases

- Touchless media control
- Assistive tech for physically challenged
- Interactive kiosk systems
- Smart mirror or smart home dashboard
